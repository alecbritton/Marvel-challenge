## Notes on the frontend section of the challenge

I am happy with the solution I have chosen for this section of the challenge. A few things to note, firstly with more time I would have stored the API key in an environment variable, or even server-side if this project were to be fleshed out even more. Secondly, I included a search button but wasn't sure what functionality to add to it, so I just added an alert for the top suggestion in the list. Finally, I would maybe include some form of loading widget while the request processes.
